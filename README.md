Project Name: Music Mood
Instructions: In your terminal type 'cd Documents' then hit enter. Navigate into the 'py-sms' folder by typing 'cd py-sms'. Run the file send_sms.py in your terminal by typing 'python send_sms.py'. From there the file should run and type anything you want to start the program into your terminal. If you want to run the exercise again you can type directly into your phone instead of the terminal since the number is already registered. Then, you will read from a list of moods. Choose and enter one of those moods into your phone, in doing so responding to the earlier message. Check what you receive!
